Soroban smart contracts for **VoteChain** — decentralized on-chain governance and voting on the Stellar blockchain.

VoteChain enables DAOs, protocols, and communities to create proposals, cast token-weighted votes, enforce quorum, and execute decisions — all transparently on-chain with an immutable audit trail.

---

## Features

- **Proposals** — create governance proposals with title, description, quorum, and voting duration
- **Token-weighted voting** — vote weight equals the voter's governance token balance
- **Yes / No / Abstain** — three-way vote with quorum and majority enforcement
- **Double-vote prevention** — each address can vote exactly once per proposal
- **Lifecycle management** — Active → Passed/Rejected → Executed, or Cancelled by admin
- **On-chain events** — every action emits a verifiable event for off-chain indexers

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vera3289/votechain-contracts.git
cd votechain-contracts
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
make test
make build
```

---

## Docker Usage

A reproducible development environment is provided via Docker.

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Start the full environment (dev container + local Stellar node)

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts two services:
- `dev` — Rust + wasm32 + Stellar CLI, with the repo mounted at `/app`
- `stellar-node` — local Stellar node with Soroban RPC on `http://localhost:8000`

### Run a one-off command

```bash
docker compose run --rm dev make test
docker compose run --rm dev make build
docker compose run --rm dev stellar contract build
```

### Open an interactive shell

```bash
docker compose run --rm dev bash
```

### Deploy to the local node from inside the container

```bash
docker compose run --rm dev bash -c "NETWORK=local ./scripts/deploy.sh"
```

> The local Stellar node RPC is available at `http://stellar-node:8000` from within the container, or `http://localhost:8000` from the host.

## Governance Contract Reference

| Function | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(admin, voting_token)` | Admin | Set admin and governance token |
| `create_proposal(proposer, title, description, quorum, duration)` | Anyone | Create a new proposal |
| `cast_vote(voter, proposal_id, vote)` | Token holder | Cast Yes/No/Abstain vote |
| `finalise(proposal_id)` | Anyone | Finalise after voting period ends |
| `execute(admin, proposal_id)` | Admin | Mark a passed proposal as executed |
| `cancel(admin, proposal_id)` | Admin | Cancel an active proposal |
| `get_proposal(proposal_id)` | Anyone | Read proposal state |
| `has_voted(proposal_id, voter)` | Anyone | Check if address has voted |
| `proposal_count()` | Anyone | Total proposals created |

### Proposal Lifecycle

```
Active → Passed   → Executed
       → Rejected
       → Cancelled
```

Full state diagram, transition conditions, and edge cases: [docs/lifecycle.md](docs/lifecycle.md)

### Pass Conditions

A proposal passes when both conditions hold after the voting period ends:

```
total_votes = votes_yes + votes_no + votes_abstain

Passed   if total_votes >= quorum  AND  votes_yes > votes_no
Rejected otherwise
```

Abstain votes count toward the quorum threshold but do not influence the yes/no majority. A tie (`votes_yes == votes_no`) resolves as Rejected even when quorum is met.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Blockchain | Stellar (Soroban) |
| Language | Rust |
| SDK | Soroban SDK v22.0.0 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

## Environment Configuration

Config files live in `config/` — one per environment:

| File | Environment |
|---|---|
| `config/local.toml` | Local Stellar node (default) |
| `config/testnet.toml` | Stellar Testnet |
| `config/mainnet.toml` | Stellar Mainnet (no real values committed) |

Each file contains the RPC URL, network passphrase, and deployed contract addresses.

**Switching environments** — set the `NETWORK` variable before running deploy scripts:

```bash
# Local (default)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Testnet
NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/deploy.sh

# Mainnet — fill in contract addresses in config/mainnet.toml first
NETWORK=mainnet ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

> **Security**: `config/mainnet.toml` is committed with placeholder values only.  
> Never commit real contract addresses or private keys.

## FAQ

Common questions about VoteChain, Soroban, voting mechanics, token requirements, and proposal creation are answered in [docs/faq.md](docs/faq.md).

## Upgrading

Step-by-step instructions for upgrading deployed contracts, rolling back to a previous version, and the version compatibility matrix are in [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## API Documentation

Every public function in both contracts is documented with `///` doc comments (description, parameters, return value, and errors).

Generate and open the docs locally:

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

The rendered HTML is written to `target/doc/`. Start with:

- `target/doc/votechain_governance/struct.GovernanceContract.html`
- `target/doc/votechain_token/struct.TokenContract.html`
